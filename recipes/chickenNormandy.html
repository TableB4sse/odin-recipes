    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 (4.5 ounce) can button mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups hot cooked rice, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sear until lightly browned, 2 to 3
            minutes per side. Remove from the skillet. </li>
        <li>Add drained mushrooms to the juices in the skillet and cook until they start to pop, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk together cream, egg yolk, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper in a small bowl; pour into the skillet with
            the mushrooms. Return chicken breasts to the skillet and simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally
            to prevent the egg yolk from setting, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run
            clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken breast should
            read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Serve with cooked white rice. </li>
    </ol>
